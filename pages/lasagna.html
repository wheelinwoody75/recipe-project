              <p><font size="5">My wife has been making lasgana since before we were married.  Her mother taught her the
                 basics and she has been tweaking, improving, evolving, and making the dish her own for 
                 20+ years. Not one person who has eaten this delicacy has ever complained. 
                  One bite is a party in your mouth and everyone is coming!!!</font></p>
